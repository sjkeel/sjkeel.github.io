    <h2>The Design</h2>
    <p> I wanted the hull to by cylindrical since the modules shipped from earth would most likely be done by rocket.
         In the middle I designed a hypothetical fusion drive since that would be the ideal and practical power source for my ship.
          In the rear I have the main propulsion thrusters and right next to that I have the radar dishes that would serve no valuable
           purpose since they are right next to the engine. I should have had them further up the main hull and pointed forward to listen
            for other ships. Also I have just a bunch of antennas and sensors sticking out of this thing with no rhyme or reason. I
            modeled the forward part of the ship with more care. It didnâ€™t help. There is a bunch of empty useless space on the ship
            between my fusion reactor and the forward guns. </p>

   <article id="future"> <h2>What I will do in the future.</h2>
    <p>Model specific parts for a specific purpose to ensure a look of functionality instead of random cool elements mashed together.
         I did well with the propulsion and fusion reactor. I would also design it to be more modular to make it seem to actually be manufactured.
          I also am thinking of building an orbital platform to dock it too. </p>

          <h4>Missing Elements Include:</h4>
          <ul>
              <li>Docking station</li>
              <li>Wires/Pipes</li>
              <li>Maybe some drone attachments</li>
              <li>depth of field</li>
              <li>Scale</li>
          </ul></article>
          <article id="learned"><h2>What I learned </h2>
          <p>Have a pre specified function to the ship. Describe the purpose and available assets used to build the ship before designing. ALWAYS USE REFERENCE MATERIAL!</p>
